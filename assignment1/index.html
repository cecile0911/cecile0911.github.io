        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I paid attention to was the text description on the
        website.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <p>
        After reading the website text, I moved my mouse and noticed that the
        large letters “Sculpture Harmony” distorted as I moved the cursor. I
        then right-clicked and tried dragging it, which caused the webpage to
        change colors and display text following the mouse’s movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I found the Menu button and browsed through the chapters in
        order, which included videos. Before the first chapter finished playing,
        I used the menu to return to the main interface, then scrolled according
        to the text prompts, discovering that scrolling also allowed me to
        switch between chapters one to three.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        While scrolling to switch pages, 3D images of the Disney Concert Hall
        appeared from different angles. This experience was very interesting,
        and I watched it several times.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>Using the navigation menu.</p>
      <h3>
        5.What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the primary goal of the website is to allow users to immerse
        themselves in the story of Frank Gehry and the Disney Concert Hall.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Through harmonious use of colors and the selection of symphonic music as
        background audio.
      </p>
      <h3>
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        The website gives me a linear impression. Since the information provided
        is not extremely varied, the presentation feels like an immersive
        reading experience with music and videos. It is suitable for slow
        exploration, possibly in sessions of ten minutes or more.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The website has a clear chapter structure, with each chapter containing
        a video that can be divided into segments which can be fast-forwarded by
        clicking. The videos themselves are not very short, which encourages
        slow and thoughtful exploration.
      </p>
      <h3>
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The design of the website evokes the layout and visual style of a
        magazine, with carefully arranged sections and imagery that resemble
        editorial spreads. Within the site, there are embedded videos,
        interactive elements that function like dynamic photos which can be
        zoomed in and out using the mouse scroll wheel, and background music
        that enhances the atmosphere. These references combine both digital and
        traditional media forms to create a rich, immersive experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The references to magazine-style layouts, embedded videos, and
        interactive dynamic photos suggest that I should actively explore the
        content at my own pace. I am encouraged to scroll, click, and zoom to
        examine details, watch the videos, and navigate different sections
        thoughtfully rather than passively scrolling through the site.
      </p>
      <h3>
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        These media references create a sense of immersion and engagement,
        inviting curiosity and attentiveness. The magazine-like presentation and
        background music set a reflective, contemplative mood, encouraging me to
        feel interested, inspired, and connected to Gehry’s work while exploring
        the experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although the dynamic photo design is impressive, the zoom speed of the
        photos is very fast regardless of how slowly I scroll the mouse wheel,
        which gives me a strong sense of dizziness. This part of the interaction
        could benefit from further refinement.
      </p>
      <h3>
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I really enjoy the website’s design elements, especially the homepage’s
        use of monochrome and clean sketch lines to depict shapes, which gives a
        unique and sophisticated impression. The text that follows the mouse
        cursor is also very creative, and the use of sans-serif fonts is
        perfectly balanced and avant-garde.
